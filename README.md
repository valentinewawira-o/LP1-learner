# Analysing the Indian start-up ecosystem
 
 
In this project I analyze funding received by start-ups in the  India start-up ecosystem from 2018 to 2021.
The dataset for 2018 and 2019 is in CSV format and 2020 and 2021 datasets are SQL files that will be imported from the server
 
Python and vs code was used in doing the analysis
 
# Hypothesis
 
Null Hypothesis :The location of a sector does not have an impact on the amount of funding
 
Alternate Hypothesis : The location of a sector has an impact on the amount of funding
